## Documentation

"Mini-Project: E-commerce API" uses Python with Flask and SQLAlchemy to simulate users' abilities to create and manage customers and their accounts, add and manage products, as well as place and track orders. This API is designed to be integrated with an e-commerce application, emulating basic functionalities while prioritizing efficiency and data integrity.

### User Interaction and Main Features

Users can interact with the API by sending requests via Postman. Requests have already been defined and are organized based on the API's main features:

- **Customer Management**: Users can easily add and update customers by entering the name, email address, and phone number of the customer they wish to add in JSON format on Postman. Users can also view and delete customers by entering their unique numeric id's, which are auto-generated by the API. 
- **Customer Account Management**: Users can also create and manage customer accounts by entering the numeric id of the customer they wish to create an account for, as well as a username and password, in JSON format on Postman. Additionally, users can view and delete customer accounts by entering their unique numeric id's (auto-generated).
- **Product Management**:  Users can create and manage products by entering a product name and price in JSON format on Postman. Users can then view and delete individual products by entering their unique numeric id's (auto-generated). Additionally, users can view a list of all products currently available. This list updates in real time with new product additions and removals.
- **Order Management**: Finally, users can place orders and view order details. When placing an order, users can enter the id of the customer placing the order, the id of the product they wish to order, as well as the order date and expected delivery date. Users can then enter order's numeric id (auto-generated) view order details, and can "track" the order by viewing its expected arrival date.

Screenshots from the program show examples of its functionalities when used with Postman:

### User Interactions

When the user first runs the Library Management System with Database Integration, the following UI will display:

```
Welcome to the Library Management System with Database Integration!
****

Main Menu:
1. Book Operations
2. User Operations
3. Author Operations
4. Quit

Please select an option from the menu above:
```

The user can select an option from the menu by entering the number that precedes it. Each selection (except for "Quit") will take the user to a separate menu, where they can then select a task. This cycle will continue indefinitely until the user selects option #4 and quits the program. Then, the following message will display:

```
Quitting program. Thank you for using the Library Management System with Database Integration!
```

The menus are as follows:

Book operations:
```
Book Operations:
1. Add a new book
2. Borrow a book
3. Return a book
4. Search for a book
5. Display all books
6. Main menu
```

User operations:

4. Main menu
```

Author operations:
```

2. View author details
3. Display all authors
4. Main menu
```

When the task has finished, the menu will display again and prompt the user to select another option. This cycle will continue indefinitely until the user selects the "Main menu" option, in which they will be returned to the main menu.

### Errors

The Library Management System with Database Integration will raise errors with accompanying messages under the following circumstances:

- ```ValueError```: If any input is blank or consists entirely of spaces.
- ```ValueError```: If a regex pattern does not match an indicated input, where applicable.
- ```ValueError```: If the user enters a non-numeric value when making a menu selection.
- ```ValueError```: If the user enters an input that exceeds the specified character limit.
- ```ValueError```: If the user enters a non-integer value when prompted to enter an integer.
- ```NotInRangeError```: If the user enters a numeric value that does not appear on the menu when making a menu selection.
- Additionally, the Library Management System with Database Integration will raise a variety of ```Exception```s, all printed in a formatted manner, when a SQL query fails to execute as intended. Examples of such failures may include, but are not limited to, searching for a library ID or ISBN that does not exist when borrowing a book, failure to connect a cursor, and attempting to add a duplicate book or library user.
